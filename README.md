# HR Data Insights Analysis 📊

This project aims to identify key internal challenges within an organization through Human Resources data analysis.

## 🎯 Objective

The dataset was sourced from the internet and simulates a real organizational environment. The main goal was to generate **insights for continuous improvement** to enhance employee performance and, consequently, increase company revenue.

## 🔍 Methodology

SQL queries were executed using Google BigQuery to explore key variables such as:

- Active employees by department
- Average salary by department
- Employees terminated in the last 12 months
- Performance scores
- Total cost per employee and by department

The results were visualized using bar charts in Google Sheets, which allowed for effective comparisons between variables.

## ⚠️ Limitations

Some important variables were incomplete or unavailable. For instance, it was not possible to extract **month and year of employee absences**, which limited the ability to provide actionable insights regarding absenteeism.

## 💡 Key Insights and Recommendations

Despite the limitations, valuable findings were identified, including:

- Recommendations for training programs in departments with low performance
- Suggestions for initiatives focused on employee well-being
- Identification of departments with high turnover rates for strategic improvements

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Google BigQuery (SQL queries)
- Google Sheets (data visualization and charts)
- GitHub (version control and portfolio)
